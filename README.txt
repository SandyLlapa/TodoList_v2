- To run the program, run the following command:
  node server.js


Basic Functions:
After logging in you will be presented with a todo-list , to create a task
click the last row on the table that says "+ Add a New Task ". This will redirect you 
to a new page to create a task. After submitting, you will be redirected to the homepage with the todo list.
On the far left of the table, there is a filter button, clicking on it will give you four options for filtering: show all, overdue task,
done tasks, and not done tasks. To the right of the filter button there is the status column, this has the checkboxes for each task. On the left 
of the list there is the edit and delete buttons for each task. To filter by the deadline, click on the header of the 
deadline column, this should turn purple when hovering over it. 

Advanced Features:
I implemented the Deadline features, so that each todo task has a deadline, items can sorted
by the deadline, and the list can be filtered to only view overdue tasks that have not been completed 


User Support:
I implemented user creation along with login and logout features. A user can only view, edit and delete 
features that they have created. To create a new account, the login page will have a 'create an account' button, clicking on this 
will take you to a webpage to insert a username and password. submitting the form will redirect you to the homepage with an empty todo list.
